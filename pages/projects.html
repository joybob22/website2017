                    <p>Here is the first project and website I ever built. This was a great project and taught me a lot of foundational things about
                    web development. Here I learned a lot about Git as I pushed my work up to Github daily and I learned a ton about HTML and CSS and how
                    different elements are inline, others are block, and positioning things how you want can be tricky.</p>

                    <p>This is my very first game I built. I learned a lot here on how you can connect JavaScript with HTML and CSS using JQuery. Once I started building
                    this game I had so much fun building it out, I realized that if you want to programmatically build something you have to understand everything there
                    is to know about it. So now I am way good at minesweeper!</p>

                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>After learning a few more things about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I decided to make a whole new static website. This was a great learning experience cause
                        I learned so much about making your sites mobile friendly and also how to make parallax images. I then later updated my resume page to have a fun interactiveness
                        to it. <em>When you click the button to go to this site it may take a moment to load since it is hosted on heroku. Thanks!</em></p>
